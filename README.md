# Community-Pantry-Management-System

This repository stores the code used in developing the Community Pantry Management System. The system uses Python as the primary language, SQL as the database, and Flask as the frontend framework. Community members can sign up and log in. One trusted member will be assigned as the admin. The users of the program can view all items remotely, request items, add items, and file issues discovered related to the pantry and its management. On the other hand, the admins will supervise the transactions (requesting and adding items) because they have the authority to verify and monitor the inventory.
